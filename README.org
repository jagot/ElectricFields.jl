#+PROPERTY: header-args:julia :session *julia-README*

A small Julian DSL for defining electrical fields, chiefly for use in
atomic physics calculations.

It is not intended to be used in the computations /of/, but rather
/with/ electric fields, i.e. the electric fields are input parameters
to (boundary terms of) a time-dependent calculation. Furthermore, the
fields are not solutions to the full Maxwell equations, but to the
paraxial approximation, which means that they are propagating along
one direction and polarized in a plane transverse to the direction of
propagation. One may however add multiple fields propagating in
different directions forming a field vector that is not confined to a
single plane.
