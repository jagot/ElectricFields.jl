In the calculations, it is useful to represent fields in terms of cycles of a fundamental frequency, which yields a timebase. E.g. one might use laser pulses of 800¬†nm, in an experiment, which has a period time of about 2.66¬†fs. It is, however, easier to calculate in normalized time, and relate all other quantities of interest (such as ionization potential, &c) to this time scale.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The package provides a simple DSL that requires just a handful of parameters, that can be given in any unit system (thanks to Unitful.jl). Different fields can be combined in any way that is physically reasonable, to recreate complicated experimental situations. Everything can then be converted to normalized time, for use in calculations.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Modules = [ElectricFields]","category":"page"},{"location":"#ElectricFields.BK7","page":"Home","title":"ElectricFields.BK7","text":"BK7\n\nBorosilicate glass is commonly used in optical lenses\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"constant"},{"location":"#ElectricFields.SiO‚ÇÇ","page":"Home","title":"ElectricFields.SiO‚ÇÇ","text":"SiO‚ÇÇ\n\nFused silica\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"constant"},{"location":"#ElectricFields.GaussianEnvelope","page":"Home","title":"ElectricFields.GaussianEnvelope","text":"GaussianEnvelope\n\nA Gaussian pulse is given by\n\nI_0expleft(-fract^22sigma^2right)\n\nwhere the standard deviation œÉ is related to the FWHM duration œÑ of the intensity envelope as\n\nsigma = fractau2sqrt2ln 2\n\nFurthermore, the amplitude standard deviation œÉ is proportional to the intensity ditto: sigma = sqrt2sigma.
